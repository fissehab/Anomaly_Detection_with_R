# Anomaly_Detection_with_R
Anomaly detection has various applications ranging from fraud detection to anomalous aircraft engine and medical device detection. In this blog post, I used anomaly detection algorithm to detect outliers of servers in a network using multivariate normal model.  The data is from the famous Machine Learning Coursera Course by Andrew Ng. The lab exercises in that course are in Octave/Matlab. I am planning to do all the programming exercises in that course with R and I have started with anomaly detection.
